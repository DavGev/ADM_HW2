# ADM_HW2
In this repository you will find the following files:
- RQ.ipynb, containing the solutions of RQ1, RQ3, RQ5, RQ7 and RQ8 
- The folder RQ2-RQ4-RQ6 contains the solutions of RQ2, RQ4 and RQ6. It is in a different folder because it was written by me (Francesco Finucci) who didn't know that we had to do it in Jupyter and i wasn't able to make them work there since i was getting an error i couldn't figure out.
In the actual RQ* file you can find the code, while in the execution.txt an execution of the code. Occasionally there will be a .png with a graph inside
- AQ1.ipynb, containing the solution of AQ1
- AQ2.ipynb, containing the solution of AQ2
- CommandLine.sh, containing the solution of the command line question

Just in case, if you can't see some plots from the ipynb files:
